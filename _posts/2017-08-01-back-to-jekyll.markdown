Hello `Jae`. This site was generated by Jekyll. 

You can add new posts by putting a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. 

You can do code snippets like this:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
  print "Hi, " + name
print_hi('Jae')
#=> prints 'Hi, Jae' 
{% endhighlight %}

You can also put images and video in.
Like this:

![Cute Turtle]({{ site.url }}/assets/turtle1.png){:height="200px"}
